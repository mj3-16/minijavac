     * Looks ahead into the stream of elements, tries to return the element as the result of the n-th call to @next()@,
     * if there is one, or @Optional.empty()@ otherwise.
     *
     * To get a feel for how this works: In the call sequence @lookAhead(1)@, @next()@, @lookAhead(0)@ on an underlying
     * non-empty iterable, all calls return the same element (which is the first element of the stream!).
     *
     * @lookAhead(0)@ is always the 'current' element, if any. On a non-empty, fresh iterable, @lookAhead(0)@ will
     * be @Optional.empty()@, because we start 'before' the first element in the stream, respecting @Iterable@ semantics.
     * @lookAhead(1)@ will point to the first element in that case.
     *
     * To fullfill calls to @lookAhead(n)@ with n greater than 1, it will call @next@ on the underlying iterable as
     * needed. A call to @lookAhead(0)@ is guaranteed not to call @next@.
     *
     * @param n non-negative integer, denoting the number of elements to look ahead.
     * @return The element which will be the return value after @n-1@ calls to @next@.
